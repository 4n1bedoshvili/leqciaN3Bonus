        "Little Women" follows the lives of the four March sisters—Jo, Meg,
        Beth, and Amy—during the Civil War era. The film explores their
        coming-of-age experiences, ambitions, and the challenges they face as
        they navigate societal expectations, love, and personal fulfillment. The
        narrative is presented in a non-linear fashion, interweaving the
        sisters' individual stories.
